# MasterMind
This is a game made in Vanilla Javascript after 3 weeks of learning this language.

## Rules

The objective of this game is to guess the combination of colored pegs placed at the top of the screen in limited number of attempts. Next to each row of pegs, there are four holes. After each attempts white hole indicates that one of the colors is guessed but is at the wrong place. Black hole indicates that one of the colors is guessed and is in the right place.
